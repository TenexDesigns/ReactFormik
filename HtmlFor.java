In HTML, the `htmlFor` attribute in a `<label>` element is used to associate the label with a form field, typically an `<input>` element. It specifies which form field the label is associated with by matching the `for` attribute of the `<label>` with the `id` attribute of the form field.

Here's how it works:

1. You have an `<input>` element with an `id` attribute, for example:

```html
<input type="text" id="name" />
```

2. You also have a `<label>` element that describes this input field. To associate the label with the input field, you use the `for` attribute on the `<label>` and set it to the same `id` as the input field:

```html
<label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
```

3. Now, when a user clicks on the label, it focuses or activates the associated form field. So, clicking on the "Name" label in your example will activate (focus) the input field with the `id` "name," making it easier for users to interact with the form.

This practice is especially helpful for accessibility because it allows screen readers to understand the relationship between labels and form fields. When a screen reader encounters a `<label>` with a `for` attribute, it will announce the label's text and indicate which form field it's associated with, providing a better user experience for individuals with disabilities.
